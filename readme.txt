Displays a thematic (choropleth) map of the United States of America showing each state shaded in proportion to the measurement of a statistical variable, such as population density or per-capita income. The value is pulled from a Ninja Form form and requires the Ninja Forms plugin.

== Description ==
Thematic Maps displays a map of the United States of America shaded in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income. It uses data gathered from a Ninja Forms form of your choice and displays the map via a shortcode on the page or post of your choice.

The typical usage is to create a form with only the 50 states of the U.S.A, select that form title from the Thematic Maps admin menu, customize the colors, and insert the shortcode into your post or page.

== Installation ==
Upload the thematic-maps directory to your plugins directory and activate from the plugin menu.
