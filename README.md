## Description
Thematic Maps displays a map of the United States of America shaded in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income. It uses data gathered from a Ninja Forms form of your choice and displays the map via a shortcode on the page or post of your choice.

The typical usage is to create a form with only the 50 states of the U.S.A, select that form title from the Thematic Maps admin menu, customize the colors, and insert the shortcode into your post or page.

## Installation
Upload the thematic-maps.zip file via `Dashboard->Plugin->Add New` and activate from the plugin menu.
